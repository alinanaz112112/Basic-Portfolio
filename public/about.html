<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! <br/>
  I am Alina Naz, and I am an electrical engineer. I have completed my master's degree in Sustainable Transportation adn Electrical Power Systems on Erasmus Mundus
  Scholarship. Currently I am working as a Graduate Electonics Engineer in Mercedes AMG HPP, UK.
</p>

<p>During my master thesis, I had the chance to work on filling missing data from a smart meter using Python. I used statistical and machine learning methods to achieve this task. During this time, I aslo got
  the opportunity to work on the front-end and back-end of the software product DERMS (Distributed Energy Resource Management System)
</p>

<p>Programming is my hobby. I program to learn something new and build something new everytime. Other than this, I also enjoy travelling and exploring new place.
